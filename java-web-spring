Steps to disable reponsiveness of navbar in bootstrap
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/examples/non-responsive/
1. remove a statement in the header 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
2. add non-responsive.css


The first value is for top and bottom padding. The second value is for left and right padding.
padding: 5px 22px; 
- top and bottom padding are 5px
- right and left padding are 22px

& in HTML is "&#38;"

If you wanna use this as placement code, make sure you add an outer-most div that contains multiple block elements
